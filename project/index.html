    <p>I am going to review the book Automate the Boring stuff with python. I will be comparing this book with other books on python I hd read. I will give an opinion on wether or not its a good book to introduce to my kids or not.</p>

    <!--Add a H2 tag describing characters, game play, or some specific part of your review-->
    <h2>The book is written by Al Sweigart. I will be reviewing the useability and how well he breaks it down. </h2>

    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
    <p> I found Al Sweigarts book <em>Cracking Codes with Python</em> significantly easier to read 
        compared to Automate the Boring stuff. The book seems to skip ahead in the
        learning process significantly fast without proper explaining at all.
        In addition to this I've come to have problems with allot of the code he wrote in this book.
        Often leading to me needing to have co-pilot completely re-write the code for me.
       <strong> I would recommend his other book Cracking codes with Python as well as Eric Matthes book
        "Python crash Course" much better books to read that do much a much better job at breaking
        things down as well as introducing to my kids.</strong>
